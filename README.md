## 📖 Brief

Bunnings is launching a brand-new customer experience to allow customers to view:

- A history of the top sizzling hot product for each day
- The top sizzling hot product over the past 3 days

## 🎯 Objective

Your assignment is to implement a solution to calculate the sizzling hot products using the business rules defined below.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## 🚦 Business Rules

1. A product sale should only be counted once per order.
   <br>
   > For example if an order contains a purchase of five hammers it should be counted as a one sale
   > towards the product sales total, not five.

   ```json
   [
     {
       "orderId": "O10",
       "customerId": "C1",
       "entries": [{ "id": "P1", "quantity": 2 }],
       "date": "21/04/2026",
       "status": "completed"
     }
   ]
   ```

2. Multiple orders of the same product by the same customer on the same day should be excluded from the product sales total.
   <br>

   > For example if a customer purchased the same product twice in one day in two separate orders, it should be counted as a one sale towards the product total, not two.

   ```json
   [
     {
       "orderId": "O10",
       "customerId": "C1",
       "entries": [{ "id": "P1", "quantity": 2 }],
       "date": "21/04/2026",
       "status": "completed"
     },
     {
       "orderId": "O11",
       "customerId": "C1",
       "entries": [{ "id": "P1", "quantity": 3 }],
       "date": "21/04/2026",
       "status": "completed"
     }
   ]
   ```

3. Cancelled orders should be credited against the product total.
   <br>

   > For example if a customer cancels an order today that was placed yesterday, that product sale should be removed from the product sales total for that day or period.

   ```json
   [
     {
       "orderId": "O10",
       "customerId": "C1",
       "entries": [...],
       "date": "21/04/2026",
       "status": "completed"
     }, {
       "orderId": "O11",
       "date": "22/04/2026",
       "status": "cancelled"
     }
   ]
   ```

4. In the case of product sales being equal for two or more products, sort the products alphabetically and select the first one in the list.
   <br>
   > For example If a "Hammer" and "BBQ" had similar sales you select "BBQ"

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

1. Implement the business rules and aggregation in a **backend or service layer** (for example **Node.js** or **.NET**). Other runtimes are fine if you document your choice.
2. Provide a way to view or run the results: **React** (web), **React Native/Expo**, or a **CLI** are all acceptable; other interfaces are fine if you briefly justify them.
3. You may combine technologies not listed above; state your stack and why in your README.
4. The solution should read the JSON sample files from the **inputs** folder.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. **Create your own repository** for your solution. Obtain this assignment by cloning it locally, copying the files into your new repo, or downloading the project as a ZIP. You **cannot fork** this repository or **push** to it, so your submission must live in a separate repo you control.
2. Read the brief and make sure you understand the business rules.
3. Use the sample files in the **inputs** folder for your calculations.
4. Commit your solution back to any publicly accessible repo in GitHub and share the URL back for review.
5. Document instructions on how to install and run your solution in the README.

## 🔨 Assumptions

1. For calculations assume today's date is 23/04/2026.
2. Document any additional assumptions you have made in your README.

## 🎓 Expected Outcomes

Based on the inputs in this repo and using the business rules in the README the outcomes should be as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap><strong>Date or Period</strong></td>
    <td nowrap><strong>Top Sizzling Hot Product</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap>21/04/2026</td>
    <td>Ezy Storage 37L Flexi Laundry Basket - White</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td nowrap>22/04/2026</td>
    <td>Ezy Storage 37L Flexi Laundry Basket - White</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td nowrap>23/04/2026</td>
    <td>Arlec 160W Crystalline Solar Foldable Charging Kit</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td nowrap>21/04/2026 - 23/04/2026 </td>
    <td>Ezy Storage 37L Flexi Laundry Basket - White</td>
  </tr>
</table>
